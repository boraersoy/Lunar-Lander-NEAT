# Lunar Lander with NEAT

This project uses the NEAT algorithm to train a neural network to play the Lunar Lander game. You can also replay the trained agents (.pkl files) with commenting run_neat function. Network configuration and mean fitness on generations are plotted.Creating a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts is recommended.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `neat`
- `gymnasium`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boraersoy/Lunar-Lander-NEAT.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to start training:
   ```bash
   python lunarlanderneat.py
   ```
